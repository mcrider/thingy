div.form-element
  label(for="inverseOf") inverseOf
  input(type="text", id="inverseOf", name="inverseOf", placeholder="inverseOf")
  div.description Relates a property to a property that is its inverse. Inverse properties relate the same pairs of items to each other, but in reversed direction. For example, the &#39;alumni&#39; and &#39;alumniOf&#39; properties are inverseOf each other. Some properties don&#39;t have explicit inverses; in these situations RDFa and JSON-LD syntax for reverse properties can be used.
