  div.description An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the &#39;typeof&#39; attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.
