div.form-element
  label(for="startTime") startTime
  input(type="text", id="startTime", name="startTime", placeholder="startTime")
  div.description The startTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g. FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to start. For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. e.g. John wrote a book from *January* to December.

Note that Event uses startDate&#x2F;endDate instead of startTime&#x2F;endTime, even when describing dates with times. This situation may be clarified in future revisions.
